# Performance of XGBoost compared to conventional technical stock analysis for predicting returns
Comparing modern data science tools and machine learn- ing to conventional stock analysis techniques

This is the code repository for my midterm paper in Decision Theory and Corporate Finance v23 at NTNU.

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of an XGBoost (XGB) classification model for predicting 5 percent stock returns over a 14-day period and compare its performance to technical analysis using Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios and the naive forecast method. Our findings indicate that the XGB model, when carefully optimized for this task, surpasses the P/E ratio-based multiple analysis in terms of overall performance and model a more balanced outcome. The XGB modelâ€™s accuracy is however inferior to the naive forecast method, even though it excels in precision, recall, and F1-score. Due to the limited test size of only 12 samples, the conclusions drawn from our study remain inconclusive. Future research with larger test sizes, more data, and increased computing power, may lead to more reliable outcomes.
